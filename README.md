# Introduction

Place this repo in the same directory as the lut_ldpc C++ program.
Compile lut_ldpc as described in its repo.
To generate the current decoder, first run a BER simulation with lut_ldpc:
```
ber_sim -p params/ber.ini.regular.example
```

Subsequently, open MATLAB and navigate into the `TopLevelDecoderGenerator`
directory and run the `decoderGenerator.m` script. All necessary parameters for VHDL generation are specified
directly in the codec file generated by `lut_ldpc`.
